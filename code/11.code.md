# Advanced Fine Tuning: Mental Health Coach


## Dataset Used in the Example


```json
{"Context":"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.\n   I've never tried or contemplated ...etc","Response":"If everyone thinks you're worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with.Seriously, the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in self-esteem. Otherwise, you can go round and round trying to understand why you're not worthless...etc"}

{"Context":"My husband and I are separated and he doesn't even want to talk to me. He says he doesn't love me anymore, but I would do anything to get him back. Is there any hope?...etc","Response":"Most important is to take care of your feelings regarding that he has left you. From your description...etc"}

..etc
```

## Using the Model in Real-World Applications and Challenges


```yaml
Input: (type 'exit' to quit):  Hello there. What are the symptoms of depression?
Output: Depression can manifest differently in individuals, but some common symptoms include:

1. Persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness.
2. Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed.
3. Changes in appetite or weight (significant increase or decrease).
4. Insomnia or excessive sleeping.
5. Fatigue or loss of energy.
6. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness.
7. Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering things.
8. Restlessness or irritability.
9. Physical symptoms like headaches, stomachaches, or body aches without a clear medical cause.
10. ...etc

Input: (type 'exit' to quit): Can you tell me more about the first point?
Output: Of course! The first point refers to my purpose as an AI Mental Health Coach. As an AI, I am here to support you through your mental health journey by providing empathy, understanding, and insights into managing emotional and psychological challenges. I am programmed to offer general advice, coping strategies, and information on mental health topics. While I can provide emotional support, it's important to remember that I am not a substitute for professional therapy or counseling. If you're experiencing severe distress or crisis situations, it's best to seek help from a qualified mental health professional.

Confidentiality is crucial in our interactions. Rest assured that any information you share with me will be kept confidential and won't be shared with anyone else.

Is there anything specific you'd like assistance with or any particular topic you'd like to discuss further?
