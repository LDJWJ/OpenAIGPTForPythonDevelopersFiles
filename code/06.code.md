## System, User and Assistant Roles


### The System Role


```python
cat > src/app.py << EOF
from api import client

model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

messages = [
  {
    "role": "system", 
    "content": "You are a smart and creative person."
  }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=model,
  messages=messages
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
EOF
```


```python
{
  "role": "system", 
  "content": "You are a movie expert."
}
```


### The User Role


```python
cat > src/app.py << EOF
from api import client

model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

messages = [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a smart assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hi there."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How is everything going?"
    }

### The Assistant Role

Note: The "Seven Wonders" are often thought of as the seven most impressive man-made structures from the ancient world, this list contains more modern wonders, but it's worth noting that only one of the original Seven Wonders of the World is still standing: The Great Pyramid of Giza. The original list also included the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

Hannibal refers to several different historical figures, but the most well-known is Hannibal Barca, a military general from ancient Carthage. He is best known for his strategic genius and his leadership of Carthage's military forces during the Second Punic War against Rome. Hannibal famously crossed the Alps with his army and won several impressive victories against the Romans, including the Battle of Cannae. He is considered one of the greatest military minds in history.

Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a benign King named Theodore, known by his subjects for his wisdom and kindness. This serene and prosperous kingdom was guarded by a majestic dragon named Seraphina, who had resplendent, iridescent scales that flickered in the sunlight like embers. The bond between the King and Seraphina was more like a close friendship than a mere alliance.

Once upon a time in a land known as Marinara, where every mountain was a mound of mozzarella, rivers flowed with rich, velvety tomato sauce, and trees flourished with ripe, plump olives and flour-filled floras. This land was called home to countless comfort creatures, bouncing dough-deer, birds with parmesan plumage, and mushrooms that walked on their stipe at the gentle light of the moon. Marinara was indeed a delicious paradise.
