# Speech Recognition and Translation Using Whisper


## What is Whisper?


## How to Get Started?


```bash
mkvirtualenv -p python3.9 whisper-learning
```


```bash
pip install -U openai-whisper==20231117
```


```bash
apt update
apt install ffmpeg
```


```bash
pacman -S ffmpeg
```


```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```


```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```


```bash
scoop install ffmpeg
```


```bash
pip install setuptools-rust==1.8.1
```


```bash

-O src/whisper/audio/Winston_Church.ogg
```


```bash
whisper \
src/whisper/audio/Winston_Church.ogg \
--model base
```


```bash
# Using the medium model
whisper \
src/whisper/audio/Winston_Church.ogg \
--model medium

whisper \
src/whisper/audio/Winston_Church.ogg \
--model large
```


```bash
[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister [..]
[00:08.320 --> 00:14.880]  of our empire, of our allies, and above all of the [..]
[00:16.640 --> 00:20.240]  A tremendous battle is raging in France and flanders [..]
[00:21.920 --> 00:27.920]  The Germans by a remarkable combination of air bombing [..]

[03:16.400 --> 03:22.000]  of the specialized and mechanized forces of the enemy [..]
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.560]  and we know that very heavy losses have been inflicted [..]

## Transcribe and Translate

Lenin_-_What_Is_Soviet_Power.ogg \
-O src/whisper/audio/Lenin.ogg
```


```bash
whisper \
src/whisper/audio/Lenin.ogg \
--language Russian \
--task translate
```


```bash
[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  What is Soviet power?
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.000]  What is the essence of this new power,
[00:06.000 --> 00:11.000]  which cannot be understood in most countries?
[00:11.000 --> 00:15.000]  The essence of it is attracting workers.
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  In each country, more and more people stand up
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  to the Prime Minister of the State,
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  such as other rich or capitalists,
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  and now for the first time control the state.
```


```bash
whisper \
src/whisper/audio/Lenin.ogg \
--language Russian \
--task translate \
--best_of 20
```


```bash
[00:00.000 --> 00:06.200]  what Soviet power is, what is the integrity of these new authorities,
[00:06.280 --> 00:11.140]  which cannot, or do not, successfully resolve in a government?
[00:11.540 --> 00:15.540]  The integrity of it attracts its workers,
[00:15.660 --> 00:19.260]  the Garze country is getting more and more,
[00:19.320 --> 00:25.580]  with the greater state control than other rich or capitalists.
[00:25.680 --> 00:29.020]  This is the first time the ..

```bash

## Using Whisper SDK in Python


```python
cat << EOF > src/whisper/whisper_test.py
import whisper

# Adjust model size as needed 
# (e.g., "tiny", "small", "medium", "large")
model_name = "base"  

try:
    # Load the model
    model = whisper.load_model(model_name)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model '{model_name}': {e}")
    exit(1)

audio_file_path = "src/whisper/audio/Winston_Church.ogg"

try:
    # Transcribe the audio
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file_path)
    print(f'The text in video:')
    print(result['text'])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error transcribing file '{audio_file_path}': {e}")
EOF
```


```bash
python src/whisper/whisper_test.py
```


```python
cat << EOF > src/whisper/whisper_translate.py
import whisper

# Adjust model size as needed 
# (e.g., "tiny", "small", "medium", "large")
model_name = "medium"  

try:
    # Load the model
    model = whisper.load_model(model_name)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model '{model_name}': {e}")
    exit(1)

audio_file_path = "src/whisper/audio/Winston_Church.ogg"

try:
    # Transcribe the audio to arabic
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file_path, 
        language="ar"
    )
    print("Arabic:")
    print(result)    
    # Transcribe the audio to chinese
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file_path, 
        language="zh"
    )
    print("Chinese:")
    print(result)
    # ..etc
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error transcribing audio '{audio_file_path}': {e}")
EOF
```


```bash
python src/whisper/whisper_translate.py
```


## Using OpenAI Speech to Text API


### Transcription API


```bash
workon openaigptforpythondevelopers
```


```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

with open("src/.env") as env:
    for line in env:
        key, value = line.strip().split("=")
        os.environ[key] = value

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ['API_KEY'], 
    organization=os.environ['ORG_ID']
)
```


```bash
API_KEY=sk-...
ORG_ID=org-...
```


```python
cat << EOF > src/transcribe.py
# Authenticate
from api import client
import os

# Define the audio file path
audio_file_path = os.path.abspath(
    "src/whisper/audio/Lenin.ogg"
)
# Define the model
model = "whisper-1"

# Open the audio file in binary mode
with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
    # Transcribe the audio
    transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model=model,
        file=audio_file
    )

print(transcript.text)
EOF
```


```bash
python src/transcribe.py
```


### Translation API


```python
cat << EOF > src/translate.py
# Authenticate
from api import client
import os

# Define the audio file path
audio_file_path = os.path.abspath(
    "src/whisper/audio/Lenin.ogg"
)
# Define the model
model = "whisper-1"

# Open the audio file in binary mode
with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
    # Transcribe the audio
    transcript = client.audio.translations.create(
        model=model,
        file=audio_file
    )

print(transcript.text)
EOF
```


```bash
python src/translate.py
```


## Improving Whisper Transcription


### Cleaning the Audio


### Using the Prompt Parameter


```bash
We need an exit. You're not far from Cypher. Cypher?
```


```bash
We need an exit. You're not far from Cipher. Cipher?
```


```python
cat << EOF > src/transcribe_with_prompt.py
# Authenticate
from api import client
import os

# Define the audio file path
audio_file_path = os.path.abspath(
    "src/whisper/audio/cypher.mp3"
)
# Define the model
model = "whisper-1"

# Define the prompt
prompt = "Cypher"
# Open the audio file in binary mode
with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
    # Transcribe the audio
    transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model=model,
        file=audio_file,
        prompt=prompt
    )

print(transcript.text)
EOF
```


```bash
We need an exit. You're not far from Cypher. Cypher?
```


```bash
We need an exit. You're not far from Cipher. Cipher?
```


### Post-Processing the Transcription


```python
cat << EOF > src/post_process.py
# Authenticate
from api import client
import os

# Define the audio file path
audio_file_path = os.path.abspath(
    "src/whisper/audio/cypher.mp3"
)
# Define the model
model = "whisper-1"

# Open the audio file in binary mode
with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
    # Transcribe the audio
    transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model=model,
        file=audio_file
    )

# Post-process the text using GPT-3
system_prompt = """You are a movie specialist. 
Your role is to correct the transcription of 
the audio file. For example, the word "Cipher" 
should be "Cypher"."""
# Define the model
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Post-process the text
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": system_prompt
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": transcript.text
        }
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
EOF
```


```bash
python src/post_process.py
```
