# Advanced Examples and Prompt Engineering


## What is Prompt Engineering?


## Few Shot Learning: A Key Prompt Engineering Technique


```text
The first programming language to be invented was Plankalkül, which was designed by Konrad Zuse in the 1940s, but not publicly known until 1972 (and not implemented until 1998). The first widely known and successful high-level programming language was Fortran, developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of IBM researchers led by John Backus. The success of FORTRAN led to the formation of a committee of scientists to develop a "universal" computer language; the result of their effort was ALGOL 58. Separately, John McCarthy of MIT developed Lisp, the first language with origins in academia to be successful. With the success of these initial efforts, programming languages became an active topic of research in the 1960s and beyond.

PROMPT:
Context: old-school rap, prevalent from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, is characterized by its uncomplicated, direct lyrical style. The lyrics often revolve around themes of social commentary, daily experiences, and storytelling, with a strong emphasis on rhyme and rhythm. The language is typically straightforward and unambiguous, with a focus on clever wordplay and rhythmic syncopation. The beats are usually funk or disco-inspired, providing a groovy backdrop for the lyrical narratives.
Task: Create lyrics for an old-school rap song about justice and equality.


RESPONSE:
(Verse 1)
Ayo, I'm bringing the word from the back, right,
In a world full of chaos, I shine a spotlight,
On the streets, in the alleys, cold and dark,
Where justice needs to land, leave the righteous mark.

Kids in the ghettos, made of steel, made of stone,
Each one born a king, but denied a throne.
Every voice should be heard, every story told,
Cos' every man's worth more than silver and gold.

(Chorus)
We need justice, we need peace,
Gotta stand up, for the ones who ceased.
In this land of dreams, we're all siblings,
Say no to the paupers, yes to the kings.

(Verse 2)
Cops on the corner, cuffing innocence,
Law ain't about oppression, but defense.
Our streets aren't warzones, they're our homes,
They supposed to protect us, not throw stones.

It's about equality, about respect,
High time the top dogs start to reflect.
We won't be pacified, won't stay quiet,
Cos' the biggest weapon is a non-violent fight.

(Chorus)
We need justice, we need peace,
No more battles, just a love increase.
Yearning for the day when we all can sing,
In the land of the free, we're all king.

(Outro)
On the mic, I fight with words, not with my fists,
Reality's tough, but hope always persists. 
Justice for all, not just for a few,
One love y'all, from this rappin' guru.
```

The word "light" can be used as a noun or as a verb. As a noun, it refers to the natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible. As a verb, it means to provide with light or to ignite or kindle.
```


```text
The word 'light' can be a noun or a verb, depending on its usage in a sentence. As a noun, it refers to illumination or a source of illumination. As a verb, it means to illuminate or to ignite something.

```text
The word 'light' can function as different parts of speech depending on its usage:

1. Noun: "Turn on the light." (referring to illumination)
2. Adjective: "The room is light and airy." (referring to brightness or weight)
3. Verb: "He will light the candle." (referring to causing something to start burning)
4. Adverb: "She ran lightly across the field." (referring to how something is performed)

To determine the specific part of speech, the context of the sentence is important.
